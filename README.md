About the Course
----------------

The goal of this class is to teach you how a compiler works, including
all of the major components from front to back. By the end of this
course, you will be able to:

- understand concepts in lexical analysis, and implement a lexer
- understand how a programming language is represented by a grammar
- understand LL and LR parsing, and write an LL parser
- understand concepts in type checking, and implement a type checker
- understand target-independent program optimizations, and implement
  several relatively simple optimizations
- understand code generation, and implement generation of x86-64

This is a programming-intensive course. Students will write a compiler for a
simple language called JPL. Prepare to spend a significant amount of time
programming.
